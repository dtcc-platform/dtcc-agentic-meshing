[build]
- source: geogram_1.9.6 release tarball
- cmake flags: GEOGRAM_WITH_GRAPHICS/OFF, EXPLORAGRAM/OFF, LUA/OFF, LEGACY_NUMERICS/OFF, HLBFGS/OFF, TETGEN/OFF, TRIANGLE/OFF, TBB/OFF
- build type: Release

[adapter]
- custom helper binary geogram_cdt (C++), links to libgeogram
- pipeline: constrained Delaunay via GEO::CDT2d + boundary subdivision + hex-grid seeding + iterative refinement
- outputs ascii mesh for harness; adapter converts to VTU via meshio

[limitations]
- uniform sizing below maxh=2.0 not supported (FeatureMissing reported for D_city_1)
- interior sampling relies on point-in-polygon tests; large PSLGs incur long runtimes at fine sizes

[timing]
- D sweep repeats=3 (warmup+timed) with caching disabled; see bench_Geogram.csv for per-case measurements
